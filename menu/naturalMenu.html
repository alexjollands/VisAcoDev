        <p>Here ants have one mission: find food and return to the nest. The purpose behind this scenario is to
            show that ants lay pheromone along their route as they go.
        </p>
        <p>The amount of pheromone on a path influences other ants - the more pheromone the more likely they will
            choose the path.
        </p>
        <p>After a little while, the colony tends to converge onto the shorter path as the ants travelling along
            it go back and forth quicker than those on a more round-about route.
        </p>
        <p>To simplify things for this demonstration, the graph has been constrained to only three distinct paths.
        </p>
        <p>Each ant chooses which path to go along based on the average amount of pheromone along the whole path
            (with a bit of randomness thrown in).
